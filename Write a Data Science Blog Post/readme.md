# Data Analysis of Airbnb Boston listings and Price Prediction:

## A Data Science Blog Post and a project as part of Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Program.

### Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to analyse Airbnb Boston listings and find meanful insights using various data visualization techniques and at the same time to write a data science blog post by describing major phases of industry standard CRISP-DM process. 

The data explored as part of this project contains detailed information provided by guests about listings and its calendar details of homestays in Boston. This dataset was obtained from [kaggle]() and also can be found on [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
Jupiter A Jupiter Notebook with all detailed analysis can be found [here] ().
